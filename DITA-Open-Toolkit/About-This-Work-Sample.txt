About This Work Sample

This project involved working with a DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) plugin. The original 
scope of work involved restoring missing headers and footers. Also, as part of the effort, 
I addressed the client’s desire to “modernize” her DITA-OT plugin to function properly 
with the most recent DITA-OT release (version 3.6.1 at the time). 

The overall work addressed issues such as:
* Making page-break behavior configurable via toggle variables defined in the XSL files
* Updating the code to function properly as an encapsulated DITA-OT plugin. 

My code updates in the XSL files are annotated with my initials and explanatory text in 
the XML comments. I added a plain-text file with brief instructions regarding installation 
and usage. In the DITA source, I’ve replaced the original content with Lorem Ipsum text 
and generic artwork to protect the confidentiality of the original content. Also, I 
supplied the PDF file that was generated from the Lorem Ipsum DITA source.
